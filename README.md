# Restaurant-POS DB Project

This is a database design project outlining the process of designing and implementing a database for a restaurant POS.

1 The Proposal discusses the needs of the system and outlines the database objectives which should be implemented to address those needs.
2 The Design document outlines my process for designing the database, discussing the tables used by the database.
3 The Diagram file is a ERD which indicates relationships and cardinality between tables
4 The Generation file is a series of SQL queries to genetate the database and populate it with test data.
5 The Queries file includes sample queries which could be effective in using the database in a practical application.
